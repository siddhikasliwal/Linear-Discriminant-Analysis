# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks in machine learning. It is a technique used to find a linear combination of features that best separates the classes in a dataset.

LDA works by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space that maximizes the separation between the classes. It does this by finding a set of linear discriminants that maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance. In other words, it finds the directions in the feature space that best separate the different classes of data.

LDA assumes that the data has a Gaussian distribution and that the covariance matrices of the different classes are equal. It also assumes that the data is linearly separable, meaning that a linear decision boundary can accurately classify the different classes.
